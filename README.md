## My process

### Tech Stack

HTML, CSS(SCSS), JS

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS(variables, nesting)
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first approach
- Vanilla JavaScript for navigation section

### What I learned

Multiple different approaches had come through my mind to solve the constuction design of the landing page. Thought, I managed to create everything with CSS Grid. The structure of the navigatation happend to be the hardest part to sync with everything else both for desktop and mobile. 
By building this project, I managed to test my skills in building and understanding more about grid layouts.

### Continued development

The JavaScript code logic needs a bit more enhancing to which I will be make more commits to this repository in the next couple of days. Also, I will be heading to create some transitions while toggling the navigation.
